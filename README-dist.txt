You've downloaded TrueCraft, an open source implementation of Minecraft beta
1.7.3. Please note that TrueCraft is still experimental, and is likely to
include bugs and unfinished features.

                           === Running TrueCraft ===

On Windows, double click `TrueCraft.Launcher.exe`. This will allow you to play
singleplayer and connect to multiplayer servers.

On Linux and OS X, run `mono TrueCraft.Launcher.exe` from a terminal.

                            === Running Servers ===

You've also been given the TrueCraft server. If you want to run a server to play
with your friends, you will need to forward port 25565 on your router.

Run `TrueCraft.exe` to host a server. On Linux and OS X, you can run `mono
TrueCraft.exe` to host the server.

If you do not want to host the server yourself, try https://gamocosm.com.

                           === Updating TrueCraft ===

TrueCraft is updated all the time. Download new versions from:

https://truecraft.io

Eventually TrueCraft will update itself automatically. Until then, you'll have
to update it yourself manually.
